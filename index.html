              how dramatically Alaska's glaciers are melting and retreating.
              Scientists from the University of Alaska and the U.S. Geological
              Survey estimate that Alaska is losing ice at the rate of 75
              billion metric tons a year. They calculate that Alaska's glaciers
              and frozen rivers are melting fast enough to cover the whole state

                <li> These graphs refer to the average temperature fluctuations on Earth over the period 1961-2022.</li>
                <li>Over this period there is clear trends of rise meaning there is a marked increase in average temperatures.</li>
                <li>Most important is that increasing of temperature has accelerated in activity since the 1980s, where the recent years recording the highest degree of temperature rise. 
                </li>
              </ul><br>
              Global temperatures in general have risen and are on the rise globally and especially so in the later years of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty first century, and rising average global temperatures directly affect glaciers. This also during summer when glaciers undergo faster melting resulting to decrease in both mass and area. This melting contributes to rise in the sea level since the water formed melts glaciers carry water into the seas.

            <p class="description">
                The trend of the atmospheric CO2 concentration with the years signifies a linear increase. Depending on the source the CO2 levels have been around 340 ppm in 1980 and have risen well over 415 ppm in the year 2022, and the graph also gives a clear indication of an upward trend. I do agree with this upward trend when bearing in mind the fact that greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase thus adding to the increase in global warming and climate change.<br> 
                The rising straight-line curve in the figure reflects the increase in atmospheric CO2 levels and global warming. More amounts of gases in the atmosphere enable the greenhouse effect to trap more heat in the atmosphere. This heat increases the pace at which glaciers in various parts of the world; and notably in polar zones where ice is known to succumb easily to heat.

              <p class="description">
                The changes in the mean sea levels over the years shows a clear and linear trend. In case of sea levels, the general average from 1993 to 2008 was stimulated from -175mm in 1880 to over 60mm by 2022. It has been rising steadily, thereby proving the effect of global warming especially through the melting of ice caps in the polar region and the thermal expansion of sea water, exerting a great effect on the human developments.<br>
                Increasing mean temperatures are also the reason for continued increase in sea level due to expansion of water because of heat expansion and through melting of glaciers and caps. It also notes that as glaciers melt, so does do the global sea levels which are dangerous to coast and marine related ecosystems. This is because the cutting down of glaciers also leads to a low supply of fresh water into rivers especially when it is warm, a factor that affects millions of humans.

              <p class="description">
                <ul>
                    <li>1955-1990: The ocean heat anomaly was also measured because it changed little over the given period and distributed between 5 to -5 x 10 ^{22} Joules. This period shows a fairly balanced partition of heat all through the oceans.</li>
                    <li>1990-2022: Perhaps the most dramatic change took place after 1990, and was manifested by the sharp rise in the ocean heat anomaly. This rise trend increased over the years to reach an anomaly of about 20 x 10^22 Joules in 2022.</li>
                    <li>This suggests the inevitable buildup of heat in the ocean especially signaling what may be new climate change processes and changes in heat circulation.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                They also point out that since 1990, the increase in near-surface ocean heat content implies that oceans are carrying most of the excess heat from global warming. Higher temperatures in water may cause high degree of glacier calving where glaciers meet the sea particularly in Greenland and Antarctica. This melting can in turn destabilize ice sheets and lead to fast rates of ice loss.

                        <li>The correlation matrix heatmap also shows these relationships quantitatively where higher intensity of blue means higher positive correlation.</li>
                        <li>The highest coefficient of determination is 0.93 between Temperature Change and Avg CO2 Level which indicates toward positive relationship as compared to the results given in the pair plot.</li>
                        <li>Sea Level Change and Ocean Heat Anomaly have very high positive correlations with Temperature Change; they both are equal to 0.92 and 0.89 respectively.</li>
                        <li>As with the other paired variables (Avg CO2 Level, Sea Leve Change, and Ocean Heat Anomaly), the correlation coefficients are positive and close to one, with values ranging from 0.92 to 0.96.</li>

                    These results indicate that the different climate change indicators are correlated and their changes exhibit similar trends, whereby as global temperatures increase, so does CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, sea level and ocean heat content.

                    The first graph, which is clearly visible as the blue line, illustrates the change of temperature in the past years, while the second one, the orange dashed line, shows the predicted tendency of change in the following 25 years.<br><br>
                    The lines of forecast state that the temperature condition will remain in a high and low oscillation. Nevertheless, the trend depicted here indicates that there is general tendency of an increase in the temperature over the next 25 years perhaps as a result of emission of greenhouse gases and change in climate. <br><br>
                    We need to know that any forecast model always contains more or less uncertainties, and therefore the changes in the future temperatures might vary with the forecasted data due to such factors as shifts in climate policies, advancement in technologies and other unpredictable factors.
